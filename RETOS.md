#¬†CHALLENGE 6: Creating xmas decorations

A couple of Christmas enthusiasts have created a Christmas decoration company. The first decoration they want to manufacture is a cube that is placed on the trees.

The problem is that they have to program the machine and they don't know how to do it. They have asked us for help to achieve it.

To create the cubes, a number with the desired size is passed to the program and it returns a string with the design of that size. For example, if we pass a 3, the program must return a cube of 3x3x3:

const cube = createCube(3)

// output:
  /\_\_\_\
 /\/\_\_\_\
/\/\/\_\_\_\
\/\/\/_/_/_/
 \/\/_/_/_/
  \/_/_/_/
As you can see, the cube has three faces visually. The symbols used to build the cube faces are: /, \, _. In order to make the cube, some spaces are needed. Also, each line is separated by a new line character \n.

Other examples of cubes:

const cubeOfOne = createCube(1)

// output:
/\_\
\/_/
const cubeOfTwo = createCube(2)

// output:
 /\_\_\
/\/\_\_\
\/\/_/_/
 \/_/_/
Take into account:

Pay attention to the spaces in the cube.
The cube has to be symmetrical.
Make sure you use the correct symbols.
Each line must be separated by a new line character \n except for the last one.

# CHALLENGE 7: Doing gifts inventories
In the Santa Claus stores they are doing inventory. There are three stores (which is represented as an Array each). In each store there are gifts.

We have been asked to write a program that tells us what gifts we have to buy to replenish our stores now that Christmas is approaching. A gift must be replenished when there is only stock in one of the three stores.

For example, if we have the following stores:

const a1 = ['bike', 'car', 'bike', 'bike']
const a2 = ['car', 'bike', 'doll', 'car']
const a3 = ['bike', 'pc', 'pc']

/* The store a1 has "bike" and "car".
The store a2 has "car", "bike" and "doll".
The store a3 has "bike" and "pc".

The gift "doll" and "pc" are only in the stores a2 and a3 respectively.
*/

const gifts = getGiftsToRefill(a1, a2, a3) // ['doll', 'pc']
As you can see, the stores can have the same gift repeated several times. But, no matter how many existences there are in a store, if we do not have it in the other two, we must replenish it to have better distribution.

üìù To sum up
Create a function getGiftsToRefill that receives three Array as parameters.
The function must return an Array with the gifts to be replenished.
A gift must be replenished when there is only stock in one of the three stores.
If there is no gift to replenish, the function must return an empty Array.
If there is more than one gift to replenish, the function must return an Array with all the gifts that need to be replenished.

# CHALLENGE 8: We need a mechanic!
Some electric sleds have broken down and the elves are looking for spare parts to fix them, but they are not sure if the parts they have are valid.

The spare parts are strings and the mechanic Elfon Masc has said that a spare part is valid if the part can be a palindrome after removing, at most, one character.

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.

Our function should return a boolean that indicates whether the spare part is valid or not with that rule:

checkPart("uwu") // true
// "uwu" is a palindrome without removing any character

checkPart("miidim") // true
// "miidim" can be a palindrome after removing the first "i"

checkPart("midu") // false
// "midu" cannot be a palindrome after removing a char

# CHALLENGE 9: Crazy Xmas lights

A company that manufactures Christmas lights has asked us to help them.

They have led strips that are like an Array. Each position is a led and can be on (1) or off (0).

Every 7 seconds, the leds change state in this way:

If the led is off, it turns on if the led on its left (index - 1) was on before.
If the led is on, it remains on.
They asked us for a program that tells us how many seconds it takes for all the leds to turn on. The seconds are expressed as an integer. For example:

const leds = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
countTime(leds) // 7
// 7 seconds because in the first change
// all the lights turned on
// 0s: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
// 7s: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

countTime([0, 0, 0, 1]) // 21
// 21 seconds because it needs three changes:
// 0s: [0, 0, 0, 1]
// 7s: [1, 0, 0, 1]
// 14s: [1, 1, 0, 1]
// 21s: [1, 1, 1, 1]

countTime([0, 0, 1, 0, 0]) // 28
// 28 seconds because it needs four changes:
// 0s: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
// 7s: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
// 14s: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
// 21s: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
// 28s: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Keep in mind
The array will always have at least one led on.
The array can have any length.
If all the leds are on, the time is 0.

# CHALLENGE 10: The Santa Claus sleigh jump

Create a program that checks if Santa's sleigh makes a parabola jump between cities. You receive a number array that represents the height at which the sleigh is at each moment.

For the parabola to be correct, the sleigh's trip must be ascending at the beginning and descending at the end. It cannot go up again once it has gone down, nor can it start the trip going down. Let's see some examples:

const heights = [1, 3, 8, 5, 2]
checkJump(heights) // true

/*
It's `true`.
The jump goes up-down.

    8 (highest point)
   ‚Üó ‚Üò
  3   5
 ‚Üó     ‚Üò
1       2
*/

const heights = [1, 7, 3, 5]
checkJump(heights) // false

/*
It's `false`.
It goes up-down-up.

  7   5 
 ‚Üó ‚Üò ‚Üó
1   3
We need the program to return a boolean that indicates whether the sleigh makes a parabola or not.

Things to keep in mind
The jump is valid if it goes up once and down once. If the sleigh stays at the same height between two positions, the parabola continues.
It is not necessary for the starting and ending points to be the same (cities can be at different heights).
